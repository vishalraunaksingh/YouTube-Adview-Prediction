# YouTube-Adview-Prediction
Youtube advertisers pay content creators based on adviews and clicks for the
goods and services being marketed. They want to estimate the adview based
on other metrics like comments, likes etc. The problem statement is therefore
to train various regression models and choose the best one to predict the
number of adviews. The data needs to be refined and cleaned before feeding
in the algorithms for better results.
